#+TITLE: My personal library of scientific works
#+AUTHOR: Luis Paulo M. Lima
#+PROPERTY: header-args :tangle yes
#+OPTIONS: toc:2

* Introduction
This file contains entries for almost all of the papers I have gathered for my research at CNU, and each entry should also be placed under an appropriate top level
heading:
- Books and theses
- Conference papers
- Journal papers
- Others references
The entries should be a level-2 heading placed under the top level heading listed above and should also be a node for Org-Roam, therefore they need a Org mode property drawer with an =ID= field.

Each entry should have the following format:
#+begin_src org :tangle no
  ,** <entry-id>: <title> <keywords>
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID: <entry id>
  :CATEGORY: <entry category>
  :END:
  - Added: <timestamp>
  - Year: <year>
  - Author: <author|list of authors>

  [<notes>]

  ,*** Resources:
  - <local file|remote resource>

  ,*** Citation
  ,#+begin_src bibtex
    @<type>{<entry id>,
        <bib-entry>}
  ,#+end_src
#+end_src

The =title= should match the actual title of the work, and =keywords= are Org tags corresponding to list of keywords listed in the work.
Additional tags not originally contained in the work could be added to improve classification and in-file search.
In the properties drawer of the entry, there should be =ID= field whose value is =entry id=.
The =entry id= should be of the format =<name><year>[-<N>]=, where =name= is the last name of the first author, and =year= is the four digit year of publication.
If there is more than one work for the same author in the same year, an additional digit =N= preceded by a dash should be added to the =id=.
It should also added to the top level heading of the entry because when I Org-roam, it auto-completes only the headings, and sometimes I can remember part of =entry id=, but not the title, so putting it there is also useful for me searching.
The =CATEGORY= field is redundant given that each entry is already under a top-level heading describing the type of entry and won't be present in an HTML view of this library.
However, it is useful for searching this file in Emacs, since =org-agenda= which is on what =library-search= is based, uses these properties for grouping and displaying results.
The value for =entry category= can be anything that helps describe the type of work, like "Book", "Journal" or "Conference".
Next, the actual content of the entries are described.

Under the top-most heading for the entry there should be a list of the authors, the year of publication, and date the entry was added:
- the =timestamp= should be added using =org-time-stamp= in the date the entry was added to the library.
- the year should have the same format as =entry id=, i.e. four digits.
- if there is a single author, they should be named in a single line.
- if there are more than one author, they should be named in a list under ``Author''.

After this meta-data, any form of notes can be added in the optional =notes=, which should be in level-3 sub-headings.
Initially, these notes were added at the end of the entry, but I found that putting them before the next sub-headings facilitates things when I use =grep= or =org-agenda= to search entries in this file.
Although any notes would do, I ideally will add a summary with my impressions of the work, which is useful to state the reason why I added the work to the library.
It is also common that I add a =TODO= state the to summary when I think that I should write it but have not done it yet.

The following subheadings should also be contained in the entry:

- Resources:

  Hyper-links to the references should be added here, preferably two, but at least one:
  - a =local file= is a external file in current machine.
  - a =remote resource= is a URL on the Internet, preferably a Document Object Identifier (DOI).

- Citation

  A BibTeX entry placed inside a Org =src-block= whose language should be =bibtex=.
  These blocks will be tangled by Org-Babel into a single [[file:./library.bib][.bib file]].

  The entry's key should be =id=, the same value used in the =ID= field in the properties drawer for Org-Roam, and =bib-entry= are the field-value pairs composing the entry.
  The =type= value is the type of the entry and should correspond to the top level heading in which the entry is placed:
  - =book=, =phdthesis= or =mastersthesis= for ``Books and theses'',
  - =inproceedings= for ``Conference papers'',
  - =article= for ``Journal papers'',
  - any other appropriate type for ``Other references''.

This is the end of the Introduction and the actual library follows from here.

:END:
- Added: <2022-05-02 Mon>

*** Notes
The first four chapters of this book are really impressive.  It
reviews the basic theory of signal processing up to a point where the
reader, if they are experienced enough with Fourier Analysis, will
turn out to have a very good understanding of the of the concept of
the wavelet transformation.

*** Notes
This was my entry point to the theory of wave propagation.  It
starts from 1D case for a string, then a rod, then beam, and give
exhaustive examples and explanations from every aspect and
question in each chapter.  It is an incredible resource for
learning but, at the same time, the math used here is very heavy.
However, by overlooking the hard points, it should help anyone
understand this topic.  I highly recommend it, and I also
recommend not to rush through it.  Take your time, it is not easy,
but it is very rewarding.

Its chapter on Lamb wave gives a very extensive and deep review on the literature which is very useful for finding old and original papers on the subject.
On the other hand, the results of the thesis themselves do not show anything new, and are (probably) obsolete.

- Authors:
  - Simon Haykin

*** Note
I usually do not like "handbooks" because they are very dense and, although I can see that they start from simpler and go to deeper topics, they lack basic theory to even understand the simpler subjects.
As a result, much of the equations are simply "throw" at me without explaining (or with no explanation at all) on how to obtain them, instead deferring explanation to numerous references.
Still, they are useful as reference books, and this seems to have useful contents on robustness of sensor arrays (chapter 4).

I have not yet read past the first few sections of the first chapter, but I have a feeling that it will be just like [[id:graff1975][graff1975: Wave motion in elastic solids]] but for sensor arrays, which is good.

The most basic text for understanding LDV scanning.  It sets the
foundation for the techniques used at ASDL in a very simple way.
It lacks, however, a deeper explanation on how the /wavenumber
filter bank/ and the /monogenic signal/ work, and assumes that
this is common knowledge for anyone reading the paper (which, in
fact, should be).

*** Notes
Very short but very insightful paper presenting the concept of
filtering in the wavenumber-frequency domain. Although it leaves
out how to generate and how to apply the windows for filtering,
this paper should be considered basic literature for the work done

*** Notes
One of the most basic works on Finite Elements Method applied to
waveguides.  In contrast with other works, this one presents a simple
method that does not involve new types of elements, and depend only on
the regular stiffness, mass and damping matrices of the matrices used
in common FEM experiments.  Basic knowledge of FEM theory is the only
requirement to understand this paper.

*** Notes
It gives a very gentle and simple introduction to the nature of Lamb waves.
It is not the original paper on Lamb waves (the one written by Lamb), but it one of the first ones to assess Lamb waves theoretically.
I have seen the original paper, and it has very heavy math, and because of that I was really impressed by the simplicity and depth of this paper.

  - B. Beardsley

*** Notes
This paper presents a very interesting algorithm for focusing the beam of an array of transducers.
By an iterative processes, the system is capable of focusing on a desired source of signal.
It mainly focus on the signal with highest energy by using cross-correlation.
However, I believe that this approach could be used in many more ways with proper adaptation.
Also, considering that this is from 1995, it is very likely that there are better approaches to this, or that this paper faded into oblivion: Google Scholar says it was cited only 60 times.

*** Notes
The most important part Section 3: "Beamforming using phased sensor array", which presents the theory that is lacking in many other papers, and that so for I have not found in books.
Also, although the title sounds very interesting, the approach used is not very new, it is very much similar with many other works that came before it.
Yet, it deserves the merit of correlating this search with spiders.

*** Notes
This one can serve as an even shorter introduction to beamforming than [[id:johnson1993][johnson1993: Array signal processing: concepts and techniques]].
I have not read it thoroughly, but the introduction by itself is very good.
I highlight the fact that it introduces the terminology to the reader, which is something that is very important for me in order to understand basic concepts.
It also provides a lengthy summary of techniques of the time it was published.

*** Notes
Presents a good formulation for beamforming factor for a square grid of sensors.
It also describes some relationship between the wavenumber of the waves and the spacing between the sensors, something it is still not clear for me.

*** Notes
A comprehensive explanation on Rayleigh maximum-likelihood estimate (RMLE).
It also makes an extensive comparison with several other methods: TOA, W-TOA, TDOA, EA, RAPID, TP, W-TP.
It introduces an interesting method for evaluating performance of detection methods, called "localizer operating characteristic curve" (LOC curve) which I want to understand more.

*** Notes
This paper explains how to implement beamforming without knowing the speed of propagation, however, I found it too difficult to understand.
At the time of this writing, I am still trying to implement it, without success.

*** Notes
A very gentle and basic introduction to Calculus of Variations.
I found that after reading this, I could understand very well the developments that appear in Lagrangian and Hamiltonian Mechanics.
It seems like it is actually aimed at engineers, because the Mathematics found in it is not heavy, and the content is presented in a form of tutorial, in a very simple and understandable way.
