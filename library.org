#+TITLE: My personal library of scientific works
#+AUTHOR: Luis Paulo M. Lima

* Introduction
This file contains entries for almost all of the papers I have
gathered for my research at CNU.  Each entry should be like this:

#+begin_src
  ,** Title of the paper
   This heading should be empty but should be tagged with the
   corresponding citation key found in library.bib.

  ,*** Authors
   The ``Authors'' should contain only a simple list with the name of
   the authors.

  ,*** Keywords
   The ``Keywords'' heading should be blank and have tags that match the
   keywords given in the paper, if any. Personal tags can be added too.

  ,*** Links
   At least one link should be given: to either a file or a internet
   reference where the paper can be found.  If the reference is online,
   a DOI is prefered.

  ,*** Summary
   A summary written by myself, sumarizing the contents of the paper.
   It should not be a copy of the abstract, by my own understanding of
   the what it contains.  It could also be simply a list with the main
   topics contained in it.  Also, a list of personal tags can be added
   to this heading.

Each entry should also be placed under an appropriate top level
heading:
 - Books and theses
 - Conference papers
 - Journal papers
 - Others references
