This is my personal library.

This repository contains a list of references that I have collected
over the years, and that I find useful for my research.  It is mainly
composed of two files:

  - `library.org`: a file created using Org-mode in Emacs, but that
    can be read as a plain text in any text editor.

  - `library.bib`: the same colection of references but presented in
    BibTeX format, which can be readly used in any TeX file.
